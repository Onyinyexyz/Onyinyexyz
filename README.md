- 👋 Hi, I’m Onyinye, a tech support agent transitioning to a full-time developer. This new found interest started out as a joke but things quickly took a turn. I became really enthusiastic about how the web is built and all the technical histories surrounding it. So, here we are today!
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript/React.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects that will challenge me to stretch my skills
